# ATM Simulation Program (C Project)

This is a basic ATM simulation program written in C as part of my coursework project. The program allows the user to check their account balance, deposit money, and withdraw money using a simple menu system in the terminal.

## About the Project

The purpose of this project is to practice using C functions, loops, and conditionals in a real-world-inspired program. While it's not a full banking system, it shows how a basic ATM interface might work internally.
